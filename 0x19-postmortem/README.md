Postmortem: Website Outage on June 1, 2024
Issue Summary

Duration:
Outage lasted from June 1, 2024, 12:00 PM to June 1, 2024, 2:00 PM (UTC).

Impact:
The main website was down, affecting all users. Approximately 100% of the users experienced service unavailability, with no access to the site during this period.

Root Cause:
The root cause was a misconfigured Nginx server that caused a failure in handling incoming HTTP requests, leading to a complete service outage.
Timeline

    12:00 PM: Issue detected by monitoring alerts indicating a 100% failure rate on HTTP requests.
    12:01 PM: On-call engineer confirmed the outage by accessing the website.
    12:05 PM: Initial investigation into network issues; assumption that it might be a DDoS attack.
    12:15 PM: Checked server logs; no signs of unusual traffic patterns.
    12:30 PM: Misleading investigation path taken into database performance, found no issues.
    12:45 PM: Escalated to the senior DevOps engineer.
    1:00 PM: Identified configuration errors in the Nginx server.
    1:10 PM: Began rollback of recent Nginx configuration changes.
    1:45 PM: Successfully rolled back configuration; tested server responses.
    2:00 PM: Service fully restored and verified.

Root Cause and Resolution

Root Cause:
The outage was caused by a recent change in the Nginx configuration intended to improve performance. The configuration error led to the server being unable to process incoming HTTP requests, causing the website to become completely inaccessible.

Resolution:
The issue was resolved by rolling back the recent Nginx configuration changes to the previous stable state. The configuration was then carefully reviewed and corrected. Further testing was performed to ensure that the server could handle requests without errors.
Corrective and Preventative Measures

Improvements and Fixes:

    Enhance the configuration change process to include more rigorous testing.
    Implement a staging environment to test all configuration changes before applying them to the production server.
    Improve monitoring to detect not only traffic patterns but also configuration discrepancies.

Tasks:

    Patch Nginx Server: Update the server with the latest stable configuration settings and apply necessary patches.
    Add Monitoring: Implement additional monitoring on server configuration changes to catch errors early.
    Review Configuration Management: Conduct a thorough review of the current configuration management process to identify and mitigate risks.
    Develop Staging Environment: Set up a staging environment to test all changes before deployment to production.
    Documentation and Training: Document the incident and provide training for the engineering team on the new processes and tools.
