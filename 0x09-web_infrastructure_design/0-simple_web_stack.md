Infrastructure Design:
User Accessing Website:
User: A user initiates the process by typing www.foobar.com into their web browser.

Domain Name: The domain name (foobar.com) acts as a human-readable alias for the server's IP address (8.8.8.8), allowing users to access the website using a memorable name rather than an IP address.

DNS Record: The "www" in www.foobar.com represents a subdomain and is typically configured as a CNAME (Canonical Name) record pointing to the domain itself (foobar.com). This record helps direct traffic to the correct server.

Web Server (Nginx): Nginx serves as the web server handling HTTP requests from clients. It receives requests for web pages from users' browsers and responds with the appropriate content. Nginx also handles static content delivery efficiently.

Application Server: The application server hosts the application code base. It processes dynamic content requests, executes application logic, and interacts with the database to retrieve or manipulate data.

Application Files (Code Base): The application files contain the website's codebase, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and server-side scripts (e.g., Python, PHP). These files are executed by the application server to generate dynamic web pages.

Database (MySQL): MySQL serves as the relational database management system (RDBMS) storing website data. It stores and manages structured data such as user information, content, and configurations.

Communication with User's Computer: The server communicates with the user's computer over the Internet using the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS (HTTP Secure) protocols. HTTP requests are initiated by the user's browser, and the server responds with the requested web pages or data.

Specifics about the Infrastructure:
Server: A server is a computer or system that provides resources, services, or functionality to other computers, known as clients, over a network.

Domain Name's Role: A domain name serves as a human-readable label that maps to a specific IP address. It enables users to access websites using memorable names rather than numeric IP addresses.

www DNS Record: The "www" DNS record is typically a CNAME record pointing to the domain name itself (e.g., foobar.com). It redirects requests prefixed with "www" to the main domain.

Role of Web Server: The web server (Nginx) handles incoming HTTP requests from clients, serves static content, and forwards dynamic content requests to the application server.

Role of Application Server: The application server executes application logic, processes dynamic content requests, interacts with the database, and generates dynamic web pages.

Role of Database: The database (MySQL) stores and manages structured data required by the application, such as user accounts, product information, and session data.

Communication with User's Computer: The server communicates with the user's computer using the HTTP or HTTPS protocols over the Internet, responding to requests for web pages and resources.

Issues with the Infrastructure:
Single Point of Failure (SPOF): Since all components are hosted on a single server, any hardware or software failure could result in downtime for the entire website.

Downtime during Maintenance: Performing maintenance tasks, such as deploying new code or updating server configurations, may require restarting services like the web server, leading to temporary downtime for users.

Scalability Limitations: With only one server, the infrastructure may struggle to handle increased traffic efficiently. Scaling to accommodate higher traffic volumes would require additional servers and load balancing mechanisms.
