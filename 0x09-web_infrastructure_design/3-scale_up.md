Infrastructure Design:
User Accessing Website:
User: Initiates a request to access www.foobar.com.

DNS Record: Resolves www.foobar.com to the IP address of the load balancer cluster.

Load Balancer Cluster (HAproxy):

Load Balancer 1: Primary load balancer.
Load Balancer 2: Secondary load balancer, configured as a cluster with Load Balancer 1 for high availability and fault tolerance.
Web Server: Serves static content and handles incoming HTTP requests.

Hosted on one server.
Application Server: Executes application logic, processes dynamic content requests, and interacts with the database.

Hosted on another server.
Database (MySQL): Stores and manages structured data required by the application.

Hosted on its own server.
Specifics about the Infrastructure:
Why Additional Elements:

Load Balancer Cluster:
Adding a load balancer cluster ensures high availability and fault tolerance. If one load balancer fails, the other can seamlessly take over, ensuring continuous availability of the website.
Split Components into Separate Servers:
Separating components into their own servers enhances scalability, performance isolation, and security. It allows each component to have dedicated resources and isolation from other components, reducing the risk of resource contention and improving overall system reliability.
Rationale:
Load Balancer Cluster:
High Availability: By configuring two load balancers as a cluster, the infrastructure can withstand the failure of one load balancer while maintaining uninterrupted service availability.
Fault Tolerance: In case of load balancer failure, the other load balancer can seamlessly handle incoming traffic, preventing downtime and ensuring a reliable user experience.
Scalability: Load balancer clusters can efficiently distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend servers, enabling horizontal scalability as traffic demands increase.
Split Components into Separate Servers:
Scalability: Separate servers for each component facilitate independent scaling based on the specific resource requirements of each component. For example, if the application server requires more processing power, it can be scaled independently without affecting the other components.
Performance Isolation: Isolating components on separate servers prevents resource contention and ensures that one component's activities do not adversely affect the performance of others.
Security: Separation of components enhances security by limiting the impact of potential security breaches. Compromising one component does not necessarily compromise the entire system, reducing the overall attack surface.
